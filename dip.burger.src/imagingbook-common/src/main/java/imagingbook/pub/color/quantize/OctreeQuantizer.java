/**
 * The principle of the octree algorithm is to sequentially read in the image. 
 * Every color is then stored in an octree of depth 8 (every leaf at depth 8 
 * represents a distinct color). A limit of K (in this case K = 256) leaves 
 * is placed on the tree. Insertion of a color in the tree can result in two 
 * outcomes:
 * 
 * (A) If there are less than K leaves the the color is filtered down the tree 
 * until either it reaches some leaf node that has an associated representative 
 * color or it reaches the leaf node representing its unique color. 
 * 
 * (B) If there are greater than K leaves in the tree some set of leaves in the tree 
 * must be merged (their representative colors averaged) together and a new representative 
 * color stored in their parent. 
 * 
 * Gervautz and Purgathofer [1] offer 2 possible criteria to be used in the selection 
 * of leaves to be merged:
 * Reducible nodes that have the largest depth in the tree should be chosen first.
 * They represent colors that lie closest together.
 * 
 * If there is more than one group of leaves at the maximum depth the algorithm could:
 * 1. Merge the leaves that represent the fewest number of pixels. This will help 
 * keep the error small
 * 2. Reduce the leaves that represent the most pixels. In this case large areas 
 * will be uniformly filled in a slightly wrong color while maintaining detailed 
 * shadings.
 * 
 * Once the entire image has been processed in this manner the color map consists 
 * of the representative colors of the leaf nodes in the tree. The index of the color 
 * map is then stored at that leaf, and the process of quantizing the image is simply 
 * filtering each color down the tree until a leaf is hit.
 * Because a limit is placed on the number of leaves in the tree this algorithm has 
 * a modest memory complexity, O(K), compared to the median cut and popularity algorithms. 
 * The time complexity is less clear. Gervautz and Purgathofer [1] cite the search phase 
 * as being O(N), where N is the number of pixels in the image. This is clearly best case 
 * behavior. The average case needs to address the complexity of the merging algorithm.
